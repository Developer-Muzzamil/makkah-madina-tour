      "fullDescription": "Masjid Quba was established when Muhammad ﷺ stopped in the village of Quba during the Hijrah (migration to Medina) in 622 CE. He personally laid its foundation and prayed there. Visiting Quba is highly meritorious: hadiths note that praying two rakʿahs here equals one Umrah. Over the centuries it has been enlarged and reconstructed; today’s white modern complex covers the original area and includes large prayer halls with many arches and domes.",

      "fullDescription": "Masjid al-Qiblatayn is renowned as the site where Muhammad ﷺ, while leading midday prayers, was instructed to turn toward the Kaaba in Mecca instead of Jerusalem. The original 7th-century mosque had two mihrabs (prayer niches) to mark both qiblas. In 1987, King Fahd had the mosque rebuilt; the old mihrab facing Jerusalem was removed, leaving only the Mecca-facing niche. The modern mosque has two small domes and twin minarets, and nearby plaques note the historic qibla change.",
