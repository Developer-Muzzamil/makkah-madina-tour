      "fullDescription": "According to Islamic tradition, the Kaaba was originally built by the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail. The current structure (approximately 13 m high) was rebuilt in the 7th century CE after earlier damage. The Kaaba is draped in a black silk and gold-embroidered cloth called the Kiswa, which is replaced annually. Pilgrims perform tawaf (circumambulation) around the Kaaba during Hajj and Umrah. Its four corners roughly align with the cardinal directions. The Kaaba has been rebuilt multiple times in history, but remains the symbolic center of the Grand Mosque.",

Today, it consists of several dark fragments held together within a silver frame on one corner of the Kaaba.

Islamic scholars clarify that while the Black Stone is a respected and symbolic relic, it holds no divine power of its own.",
