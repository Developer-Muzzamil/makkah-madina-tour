The site is also held in high reverence by Muslims as it is where the very first congregational salah was prayed facing the holy Kaaba. Ages ago, Masjid al-Qiblatain was the only mosque in the city consisting of two Mihrabs, hence the name.

So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram.” — (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:144) ��       Why It’s Called Masjid al-Qiblatain ● The name “Qiblatain” literally means “Two Qiblas.” ● During that historic prayer, the Prophet ﷺ turned mid-prayer, shifting direction from Jerusalem to Makkah. ● The companions behind him followed his lead, completing the prayer facing the new Qibla — the Kaaba. ● Originally, the mosque had two mihrabs (prayer niches) — one facing Jerusalem and the other facing Makkah.",

The mosque derives its name from the Arabic word ghamāmah meaning cloud  in reference to a miraculous event during the time of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. According to Islamic tradition, during a period of severe drought in Madinah, the Prophet ﷺ led a special ṣalāt al-istisqāʾ (prayer for rain) at this very location. As he prayed, a cloud appeared overhead, and Allah sent down rain, ending the drought. This event became a powerful symbol of divine mercy and the accepted supplication of the Prophet ﷺ.",
    "fullDescription2":"In addition to the rain prayer, historical accounts also mention that the Prophet ﷺ and later caliphs performed Eid prayers at this site when the main mosque could not accommodate the growing number of worshippers. The area has long served as an overflow prayer space, especially during large congregational gatherings. Today, Masjid al-Ghamāmah no longer functions as an active mosque but remains a cherished landmark within an enclosed courtyard surrounded by a low stone wall. Pilgrims visiting Madinah often stop here to reflect on the Prophet’s humility and connection with his Lord, and to appreciate the deep historical and spiritual legacy associated with this site.",

The mosque takes its name from the Arabic word Ijābah, meaning “response” or “acceptance,” because it is here that the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ reportedly made three heartfelt supplications to Allah. According to an authentic hadith narrated by ‘Amir bin Sa’d from his father (Sahih Muslim), the Prophet ﷺ prayed for three things: that his Ummah would not be destroyed by famine, that they would not be overwhelmed by external enemies, and that they would not fight among themselves. Allah granted the first two requests, but not the third, a poignant reminder of the trials the Muslim community would later face..",
    "fullDescription2":"The mosque's historical foundation dates back to the time of the Prophet ﷺ and was originally built near the house of Bani Muawiyah, a well-known clan in Madinah. Though the current structure has undergone renovations and reconstruction over the centuries, it remains a modest and peaceful place of worship, visited by pilgrims who wish to reflect and pray at a site where divine intervention was witnessed. Its simple architecture contrasts with the grand scale of nearby mosques, yet its significance lies in the spiritual legacy and answered prayers associated with it. The mosque continues to serve as a powerful symbol of hope and divine mercy in Islamic tradition.",
